# Bookshelf App

## Welcome to my Bookshelf app! 

I love buying books, specifically used books. 
Last year, I discovered the holy-grail of used bookstores. The Garland County Library in Arkansas has a 'Friends of the Library' bookstore in the back of their library, where they sell used books, movies, cds, audiobooks, and more. 

### From the Garland County website: 

><h2> The Friends of the Garland County Library was incorporated in 1976 as an Arkansas non-profit. The group's purpose is to increase library services by:</h2>

><ul>
>  <li>raising funds through the sale of donated books, magazines, and other materials that are available year-round in the library's Book Sale Room</li>
>  <li>raising funds through the sale of donated books, magazines, and other materials that are available year-round in the library's Book Sale Room</li>
>  <li>raising funds through an annual book sale</li>
>  <li>soliciting supporting membership by the public</li>
></ul>
><h2>All of the money raised goes to the library to fund special programs or purchase materials.</h2>

## Why I built this. 

After discovering the GC bookstore, I decided to build an app and create a database to digitally store my purchases and visualize my growing library.

This is my first personal project since finishing Tech Elevator's software engineering bootcamp. 

### What I used to build this

For this project, I incorporated the full-stack dev tools I learned in my bootcamp, including :
- Java 
- Postgresql
- HTML / CSS 
- Vue 
- Springboot 
- and more!

## Users / Authentication 

After getting the basic site up and running, I brought in some code I used in a Brewery Finder App project I worked on in my Tech Elevator Bootcamp. It's the only code brought in from somewhere else. I want my friends to be able to use this too, and I want this project to be a means for me and my friends to "check-out" (borrow) books found in our own individual libraries.
