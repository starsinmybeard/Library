# Bookshelf App

### Welcome to my Bookshelf app! 

I love buying books, specifically used books. 
Last year, I discovered the holy-grail of used bookstores. The Garland County Library in Arkansas has a 'Friends of the Library' bookstore in the back of their library, where they sell used books, movies, cds, audiobooks, and more. 

From the Garland County website: 


><h2> The Friends of the Garland County Library was incorporated in 1976 as an Arkansas non-profit. The group's purpose is to increase library services by:</h2>

><ul>
>  <li>raising funds through the sale of donated books, magazines, and other materials that are available year-round in the library's Book Sale Room</li>
>  <li>raising funds through the sale of donated books, magazines, and other materials that are available year-round in the library's Book Sale Room</li>
>  <li>raising funds through an annual book sale</li>
>  <li>soliciting supporting membership by the public</li>
></ul>
><h2>All of the money raised goes to the library to fund special programs or purchase materials.</h2>
